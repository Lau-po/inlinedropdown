## DropDown menu with old jquey

The aim of this repo is to recreate an inline dropdown using an old framework with new usage.
It doesn't look good actually but It works and does what It means to do.

##Using class and id to rebuild a menu

The JS is reading every children of `#uppernav` to get which ones have a dropdown linked to It.
If It finds a `li` with the `has-child` class, It will automatically add an `onclick` action on It and manage to show the dropdown.

##Do what you want with It and don't hesitate to open issues, or create pull request :)
